        <p>Hello, my name is Hayden.</p><br>

        <p>I am originally from Laguna Niguel, California. I still live here today!</p><br>

        <p>After high school, I moved to Santa Barbara for a year and lived in Isla Vista
        while attending Santa Barbara City College.</p><br>

        <p>After a year, I decided to move to San Francisco. I live there for 5 years and 
          worked as a meat and fish cutter for Whole Foods. I moved back home to Laguna Niguel 
          a few years ago, and have been working an IT job at an office since moving back.</p><br>
          
          <p>I am very excited to be in the bootcamp, and can not wait until we get into Javascript.
          My goal is to move into a web development job after completing the program. 
          In my free time I enjoy bad movies, video games, and IPAs.</p>
